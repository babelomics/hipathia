# HiPathia

HiPathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along
signaling pathways. The method is based on an iterative algorithm which
is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a
network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and
the intensity of the signal arriving to it.
