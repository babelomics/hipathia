Description: Hipathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along
  signaling pathways from transcriptomic data. The method is based on an 
  iterative algorithm which
  is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a
  network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and
  the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach 
  to functional analysis allowing to compute the signal arriving to the 
  functions annotated to each pathway.
