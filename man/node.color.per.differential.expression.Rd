\title{Colors of the nodes by its differential expression}
\usage{
node.color.per.differential.expression(results, metaginfo, groups, group1.label,
  group2.label, group.by = NULL, colors = "classic", conf = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Object of results as provided by the \code{hipathia}
function.}

\item{metaginfo}{Object of pathways.}

\item{groups}{Vector with the class to which each sample belongs.
Samples must be ordered as in \code{results}}

\item{group1.label}{String, label of the first group to be compared}

\item{group2.label}{String, label of the second group to be compared}

\item{group.by}{How to group the subpathways to be visualized. By default
they are grouped by the pathway to which they belong. Available groupings
include "uniprot", to group subpathways by their annotated Uniprot functions,
"GO", to group subpathways by their annotated GO terms, and "genes", to group
subpathways by the genes they include.}

\item{colors}{Either a character vector with 3 colors (indicating,
in this order, down-regulation, non-significance and up-regulation colors)
 or a key name indicating the color scheme to be used. Options are:}

\item{conf}{Level of significance of the comparison for the adjusted p-value}
}
\value{
List of color vectors, named by the pathways to which they belong.
The color vectors represent the differential expression
of the nodes in each pathway.
}
\description{
Performs a differential expression on the nodes and computes the colors
of the nodes depending on it. Significant up- and down-regulated nodes
are depicted with the selected color, with a gradient towards the
non-significant color depending on the value of the p-value.
Smaller p-values give rise to purer colors than higher p-values.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{classic}}{ColorBrewer blue, white and colorBrewer red.}

\item{\code{hipathia}}{Hipathia predefined color scheme: Green, white and orange.
By default \code{classic} color scheme is applied.}
